# Tic Tac Toe

Play Tic Tac Toe against a computer! This game uses Ruby and is played in the console.

## Instructions

1. Install ruby if you do not already have it.
2. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/alikew24/TicTacToe/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip the zip file. In the terminal, navigate to the TicTacToe-master directory.
4. Type 'bundle install' in the console.
5. Type 'ruby game.rb' to start the game!

## How To Play

Learn more about the rules of Tic Tac Toe [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

To play, you simply type in the row number, followed by a comma, and then the column number of the spot where you would like to move. Then, press enter.

Example: 0,0

## Future Directions

I would like to add the option for two human players to play against each other.
Also, I would like to have computers with different levels of difficulty. Right now,
the computer is unbeatable. I would like to give the player the option to play against
a less difficult computer.
